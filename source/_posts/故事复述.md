**原文：**  
As one approaches some crossroads, one comes to a sign which says that drivers have to stop when they come to the main road ahead.  
**译文：**  
当人们接近某些十字路口时，会看到一个标志，标志上写着驾驶员到达前方主干道时必须停车。

**原文：**  
At other crossroads, drivers have to go slow, but they do not actually have to stop (unless, of course, there is something coming along the main road);  
**译文：**  
而在其他的十字路口，驾驶员必须减速，但实际上不需要完全停车（除非，当然，主路上有车辆驶来）。

**原文：**  
and at still others, they do not have either to stop or to go slow, because they are themselves on the main road.  
**译文：**  
还有一些十字路口，驾驶员既不用停车也不用减速，因为他们本身就在主路上。

**原文：**  
Mr Williams, who was always a very careful driver, was driving home from work one evening when he came to a crossroads.  
**译文：**  
威廉姆斯先生是个非常小心的司机，某天傍晚他下班开车回家时，来到一个十字路口。

**原文：**  
It had a 'Slow' sign, so he slowed down when he came to the main road, looked both ways to see that nothing was coming, and then drove across without stopping completely.  
**译文：**  
这个路口有一个“慢行”标志，所以他到主路时减速了，左右看了一下，确认没有车辆驶来后，便没有完全停车直接通过了。

**原文：**  
At once he heard a police whistle, so he pulled in to the side of the road and stopped.  
**译文：**  
随即他听到一声警哨，于是把车停在路边。

**原文：**  
A policeman walked over to him with a notebook and pencil in his hand and said, 'You didn’t stop at that crossing.'  
**译文：**  
一名警察拿着笔记本和铅笔走过来对他说：“你在那个路口没有停车。”

**原文：**  
'But the sign there doesn’t say "Stop",' answered Mr Williams. 'It just says "Slow", and I did go slow.'  
**译文：**  
“可是标志上并没有写‘停车’，”威廉姆斯先生回答，“它只是写了‘慢行’，而我确实减速了。”

**原文：**  
The policeman looked around him, and a look of surprise came over his face.  
**译文：**  
警察环顾四周，脸上露出惊讶的表情。

**原文：**  
Then he put his notebook and pencil away, scratched his head and said, 'Well, I’ll be blowed! I am in the wrong street!'  
**译文：**  
然后他收起笔记本和铅笔，挠了挠头说：“哎呀，搞错了！我走错街了！”

**原文：**  
Before the last war, officers in the navy had a lot more freedom when their ship was in port than they have nowadays.  
**译文：**  
在上次战争之前，海军军官在船只停靠港口时比现在有更多的自由。

**原文：**  
They were expected to lead a busy social life, and to take an active part in sport ashore.  
**译文：**  
他们被期望过着忙碌的社交生活，并积极参与岸上的体育活动。

**原文：**  
It was therefore rather difficult for them to find time to do all their other duties.  
**译文：**  
因此，他们很难找到时间完成所有其他职责。

**原文：**  
Usually, all the officers in a ship used to have a regular meeting together once a week to receive orders from their captain, make reports and discuss any business that had to be discussed, such as who should represent the ship in the next football match.  
**译文：**  
通常，船上的所有军官每周会定期开会一次，以接受船长的命令、做报告并讨论需要讨论的事务，例如谁应代表船参加下一场足球比赛。

**原文：**  
One such meeting was being held on board a ship one day, and after the regular business had been completed, the time came to discuss the date of the next meeting.  
**译文：**  
一天，船上正在举行这样的会议，例行事务完成后，他们开始讨论下一次会议的日期。

**原文：**  
Friday of the next week was suggested, and so was Monday of the week after, but both of them interfered with somebody’s arrangements for the weekend, and in the end it was generally agreed that the meeting should be held on Wednesday, as this would be the least likely day to interfere with anybody’s convenience, since it was right in the middle of the week.  
**译文：**  
有人建议在下周五开会，也有人建议下周一，但这两天都干扰了某些人的周末安排，最终一致同意在周三开会，因为这是最不可能影响任何人方便的日子，因为它正好在一周的中间。

**原文：**  
As the officers were leaving, however, one of them was heard to say, ‘Wednesday is the worst day, because it interferes with two weekends!’  
**译文：**  
然而，当军官们离开时，有人听到一个军官说：“周三是最糟糕的一天，因为它影响了两个周末！”

Mr and Mrs Williams had always spent their summer holidays in England in the past, in a small boarding-house at the seaside.  
**译文：**  
威廉姆斯先生和夫人过去总是在英国的一个海边小旅馆度过他们的暑假。

**原文：**  
One year, however, Mr Williams made a lot of money in his business, so they decided to go to Rome and stay at a really good hotel while they went around and saw the sights of that famous city.  
**译文：**

**译文：**  
他们飞到了罗马，在一个晚上很晚的时候到达了酒店。

They expected that they would have to go to bed hungry, because in the boarding-houses they had been used to in the past, no meals were served after seven o’clock in the evening.  
**译文：**  
他们以为自己会饿着肚子睡觉，因为他们以前住过的旅馆晚上七点以后就不再提供餐食。

**原文：**  
They were therefore surprised when the clerk who received them in the hall of the hotel asked them whether they would be taking dinner there that night.  
**译文：**  
所以当酒店大堂的接待员问他们当晚是否要用晚餐时，他们感到非常惊讶。

**原文：**  
‘Are you still serving dinner then?’ asked Mrs Williams.

‘Well, sir,’ answered the clerk, ‘we serve breakfast from seven to half-past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to half-past nine.’  
**译文：**  
“嗯，先生，”接待员回答，“我们早餐从早上七点供应到十一点半，中餐从十二点到下午三点，下午茶从四点到五点，晚餐从六点到九点半。”

**原文：**  
‘But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of Rome!’ said Mrs Williams in a disappointed voice.

“可这几乎没剩下时间让我们去看罗马的景点了！”威廉姆斯夫人失望地说道。

Some young soldiers who had recently joined the army were being trained in modern ways of fighting, and one of the things they were shown was how an unarmed man could trick an armed enemy and take his weapon away from him.  
**译文：**  
一些最近参军的年轻士兵正在接受现代作战方式的训练，其中之一是如何让一个手无寸铁的人智取武装敌人并夺走他的武器。

The young soldier who had to answer this question thought carefully for a few seconds before he answered, and then said, ‘Well, after what I have just seen, I think that the first thing I would do would be to get rid of my rifle as quickly as I could so that the unarmed enemy soldier couldn’t take it from me and kill me with it!’  
**译文：**

**原文：**  
A certain poet had written a play, and arrangements were being made to perform it.  
**译文：**  
某位诗人写了一部戏剧，正在安排上演。

**原文：**  
Of course, the poet was asked to give his advice on the scenery, the lighting, and all the other things that help to make a play successful, and he proved to be a very difficult man to please, as he had his own very definite ideas of how each scene should look.  
**译文：**  
当然，这位诗人被要求就布景、灯光及其他能让戏剧成功的元素提出建议。他证明自己是个难以取悦的人，因为他对每个场景的呈现都有非常明确的想法。

In one of the scenes in the play, it was necessary to produce the effect of a wonderful sunset, which the young lovers watched together before singing one of their great love songs.  
**译文：**

**原文：**  
The theatre electricians worked very hard to produce this sunset effect.

**原文：**  
They tried out all kinds of arrangements and combinations of lights—red lights, orange lights, yellow lights, blue lights, lights from above, lights from behind, lights from the front, lights from the sides—but nothing satisfied the poet, until suddenly he saw exactly the effect that he had been dreaming of producing ever since he had written his play.  
**译文：**  
他们尝试了各种灯光的排列和组合——红灯、橙灯、黄灯、蓝灯，从上方、后方、前方、侧面照射的灯光——但都未能让诗人满意，直到某一刻，他看到了自己写剧本时梦想中的效果。

**原文：**  
‘That’s it!’ he shouted excitedly to the electricians behind the stage. ‘That’s just right! Keep it exactly like that!’  
**译文：**  
“就是这个效果！”他激动地对舞台后面的电工喊道，“完全正确！就保持这个样子！”

‘I’m sorry, sir,’ answered the chief electrician, ‘but we can’t keep it like this.’  
**译文：**  
“很抱歉，先生，”首席电工回答，“但我们不能保持这个效果。”

**原文：**  
‘Why ever not?’ asked the poet angrily.  
**译文：**  
“为什么不行？”诗人愤怒地问。

**原文：**  
‘Because the theatre is on fire, sir,’ answered the chief electrician. ‘That’s what’s producing the effect you can see now!’

“因为剧院着火了，先生，”首席电工回答，“现在您看到的效果正是火造成的！”

Nasreddin never seemed to have enough money to pay his bills, so he always owed money to the shopkeepers in his town.  
**译文：**  
纳斯雷丁似乎从来没有足够的钱来支付账单，所以他总是欠镇上店主的钱。

Most of them were patient, understanding men and did not speak to him very often about the money that he owed them, but there was one who was not at all patient, and who was also very fond of money.  
**译文：**  
大多数店主都很有耐心、通情达理，不常提起他欠的钱，但有一个人完全没有耐心，而且非常喜欢钱。

Whenever this man saw Nasreddin, he reminded him of the money that he had not yet paid him, and he very often did this in front of Nasreddin’s best friends, which made Nasreddin feel very uncomfortable, as he did not want his friends to know that he was so poor.

**译文：**  
“嗯，”纳斯雷丁说，“如果我这个月付你四十里拉，下个月再付四十，之后的一个月再付四十，那我还欠你多少钱？”

**原文：**  
‘You would then owe me two liras, of course,’ answered the shopkeeper.

The newspapers were full of stories of people who had been cheated by men who went from house to house saying that they were collecting for soldiers who had been seriously wounded in the war, or for people who had lost their homes, or for some other noble cause, while all the time they were putting the money they collected into their own pockets instead of using it for the purposes they claimed to be collecting it for.  
**译文：**  
报纸上充满了这样的故事：一些人逐户声称自己在为战争中受重伤的士兵、失去家园的人或其他崇高的目的募捐，但实际上却把募来的钱装进了自己的口袋，而不是用于他们声称的用途。

**原文：**  
One day Mr Smith came back with another story of this kind.  
**译文：**  
一天，史密斯先生带回了一个类似的故事。

**原文：**  
He told his wife that a group of people had collected thousands of dollars for the widow of the Unknown Soldier.  
**译文：**  
他告诉妻子，有一群人为无名战士的遗孀募捐了数千美元。

**原文：**  
Then someone had written to the papers about it, and they had written articles to warn other people.  
**译文：**  
然后有人把这件事写信告诉了报纸，报纸还写了文章警告其他人。

**原文：**  
Mr Smith said that he and his friends at the office had had a good laugh about the story when they had read it in the newspaper.  
**译文：**  
史密斯先生说，他和办公室的朋友在看了这则报道后大笑了一场。

**原文：**  
‘Can you imagine anyone being so stupid as to believe that story and give money for the widow of the Unknown Soldier?’ he asked his wife.  
**译文：**  
“你能想象有人居然蠢到相信这个故事，并为无名战士的遗孀捐钱吗？”他问妻子。

**原文：**  
She looked puzzled at first, but then her face brightened.  
**译文：**  
她起初感到困惑，但随后脸色一亮。

**原文：**  
‘Oh, yes! I see now!’ she answered. ‘Of course, the government pays the widow of the Unknown Soldier!’

Most of Nasreddin’s neighbours were pleasant people, who were always ready to help each other when they were in trouble; but there was one woman who lived in his street who was disliked by everybody because she was always interfering in other people’s business, and because she was always borrowing things from people and then forgetting to give them back.

**原文：**  
She loved driving very fast, and boasted of the fact that she had never, in her thirty-five years of driving, been punished for a driving offence.  
**译文：**  
她喜欢开快车，并以自己三十五年的驾龄从未因交通违法而受罚为荣。

**原文：**  
Then one day she nearly lost her record.  
**译文：**  
有一天，她差点打破了自己的纪录。

**原文：**  
A police car followed her, and the policemen in it saw her pass a red light without stopping.  
**译文：**  
一辆警车跟在她后面，车上的警察看到她闯了红灯而没有停车。

**原文：**  
When Mrs Jones came before the judge, he looked at her severely and said that she was too old to drive a car, and that the reason why she had not stopped at the red light was most probably that her eyes had become weak with old age, so that she had simply not seen it.  
**译文：**  
当琼斯夫人出现在法官面前时，法官严肃地说，她年纪太大，不能再开车了。她闯红灯可能是因为年纪大了，视力减弱，所以根本没看到红灯。

**原文：**  
When the judge had finished what he was saying, Mrs Jones opened the big handbag she was carrying and took out her sewing.  
**译文：**  
法官说完后，琼斯夫人打开随身携带的大手袋，拿出了针线活。

**原文：**  
Without saying a word, she chose a needle with a very small eye, and threaded it at her first attempt.  
**译文：**  
她一言不发，挑出了一根针眼非常小的针，一次就穿好了线。

**原文：**  
When she had successfully done this, she took the thread out of the needle again and handed both the needle and the thread to the judge, saying, ‘Now it is your turn.  
**译文：**  
成功穿好后，她又将线从针中拉出，把针和线一起递给法官，说：“现在轮到您了。

**原文：**  
I suppose you drive a car, and that you have no doubts about your own eyesight.’  
**译文：**  
我想您会开车吧，而且对自己的视力没有怀疑吧。”

**原文：**  
The judge took the needle and tried to thread it. After half a dozen attempts, he had still not succeeded.  
**译文：**  
法官接过针，试图穿线，但试了六次都没有成功。

**原文：**  
The case against Mrs Jones was dismissed, and her record remained unbroken.  
**译文：**  
对琼斯夫人的指控被驳回，她的纪录仍未打破。

**原文：**  
When a big ship is in very rough sea, it has to be able to bend a little, otherwise it may break in two.  
**译文：**  
当一艘大船在汹涌的海上航行时，它必须能够稍微弯曲，否则可能会断成两截。

**原文：**  
If one end of the ship is on the top of one huge wave, and the other end is on the top of another, with the middle of the ship hanging in between; or if one huge wave comes up under the middle of the ship, leaving the two ends hanging, the ship’s own weight will break its back if it is quite stiff.  
**译文：**  
如果船的一端在一个大浪的顶部，而另一端在另一个大浪的顶部，船中间悬空；或者一个大浪从船中间下方涌起，让两端悬空，如果船很僵硬，船体自重会使它断裂。

**原文：**  
To make a big ship elastic enough to avoid this danger, it has joints where the sections of the ship come together above the water-line, and these joints open and shut slightly as the waves lift one section of the ship or another.  
**译文：**  
为了让大船足够灵活以避免这种危险，船的水线以上部分会有接缝，这些接缝会随着海浪抬高船的某一部分而稍微开合。

**原文：**  
This is enough to save the ship from breaking into pieces.  
**译文：**  
这足以让船避免断裂。

**原文：**  
One day a sailor was walking along a passage-way in a big ship during a storm when he was surprised to see a boy sitting comfortably in a chair at the end of the passage-way, which was opposite one of the ship’s joints.  
**译文：**  
一天，一名水手在暴风雨中走过大船的通道时，惊讶地看到一个男孩舒适地坐在通道尽头的椅子上，那个位置正对着船的一个接缝。

**原文：**  
The boy had a bag of nuts beside him, and every time the ship was lifted by a wave and the joint opened, he put a nut in it.  
**译文：**  
男孩旁边有一袋坚果，每次船被海浪抬起，接缝打开时，他就往里面放一个坚果。

**原文：**  
As the ship came down again, the joint closed and cracked the nut, gently but firmly.  
**译文：**  
当船再次下沉时，接缝闭合并轻柔但有力地压碎了坚果。

**原文：**  
The boy then took it out and put the next one in as the joint opened again.  
**译文：**  
然后男孩把坚果取出来，再在接缝再次打开时放进去下一个。
